In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, **agentic coding** is emerging as a transformative paradigm. Unlike traditional autocomplete tools, AI agents are beginning to understand intent, manage complex workflows, and collaborate with developers in ways previously unimagined.

## Why Agents Matter

Agents aren't just writing code; they are:
- **Planning**: Breaking down complex requests into manageable tasks.
- **Executing**: Writing, testing, and debugging code autonomously.
- **Verifying**: Ensuring that the final output matches the user's requirements and design standards.

Stay tuned as we explore how these digital collaborators are shaping the future of the web.
